# Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world marketing analytics scenario by analyzing customer interaction data to extract insights about sentiment, engagement trends, and behavioral patterns. The goal was to build an end-to-end dashboard system for decision support, showcasing foundational skills in SQL, Python, and Power BI.

- Build an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize marketing KPIs<br>
- Simulate an executive-level presentation of findings using PowerPoint

# Key Features
- Customer Sentiment Scoring: Applied VADER sentiment analysis to text reviews and aggregated results by product, price, and country<br>
- Engagement Trends: Created visuals showing monthly/quarterly trends in customer engagement<br>
- Content Effectiveness: Compared KPIs across different content types<br>
- Dashboard Interactivity: Implemented filters/slicers for product, content type, and sentiment level<br>

# Next Steps / Improvements
Explore deeper NLP techniques beyond VADER (e.g. topic modeling)
